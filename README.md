# Solving-Chemical-Equations-Part-6b-The-Solution-...-Finally

These updated classes finishes up everything.  rowEchelon finishes by extracting a solution form a matrix in row echelon form.  chemicalEquation finishes up by importing this solution to the equation, checking that the equation is balanced, and finally a way to output a balanced equation.  A detailed description of each method as well as the driver can be found at the above post
